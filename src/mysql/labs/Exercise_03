*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day
* SELECT * FROM air_travel.flights WHERE take_off > "2021-09-22 10:00:00" AND take_off < "2021-09-24 10:00:00" ;
*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day
*  SELECT * FROM air_travel.flights
   JOIN destinations d
   ON flights.destination_id = d.destination_id
   WHERE d.city = "London";

*
*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today


*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight
*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday
*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year
*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year
*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports
*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights
*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
